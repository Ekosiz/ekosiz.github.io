Hello! I'm [Ekosiz](https://github.com/Ekosiz), a cybersecurity enthusiast who enjoys solving challenges and learning new techniques. My passion for ethical hacking and cybersecurity started with platforms like [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), where I solve various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and share my solutions here.

I believe in continuously improving my skills while contributing to the community by documenting my journey and writeups. This blog is a collection of my solutions to challenges, along with step-by-step guides and insights Iâ€™ve gained throughout my learning experience.

## Cool Features of This Blog

- Detailed writeups for CTF challenges.
- A place for me to document my learning process and solutions, so I can revisit them and help others along the way.
